# Introduction to Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. At Texas A&M, I was part of an org called datathon. [Datathon](https://tamudatathon.org/) is basically a hackathon focused on data. In this post, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that every aspiring web developer should know.

## What is Web Development?

Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It encompasses both the visual aspects that users see (frontend) and the behind-the-scenes functionality (backend).

## Key Technologies

- **HTML**: The structure of web pages
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality

## Getting Started

The best way to learn web development is by building projects. Start small, be consistent, and don't be afraid to experiment with new technologies.

Remember, every expert was once a beginner!
