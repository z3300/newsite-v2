# Mastering CSS Layouts

CSS layouts have evolved significantly over the years. Today, we have powerful tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid that make creating responsive layouts easier than ever.

## Flexbox Fundamentals

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts. It excels at distributing space and aligning items within a container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## CSS Grid Power

CSS Grid is ideal for two-dimensional layouts, giving you complete control over both rows and columns.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use Flexbox for component-level layouts
- Use CSS Grid for page-level layouts
- Always consider mobile-first design
- Test across different screen sizes

Practice these techniques, and you'll master modern CSS layouts in no time!
