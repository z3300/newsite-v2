Hi, my name is Zeeshan Chatur. I’m a recent graduate of Texas A&M University, where I majored in Management Information Systems.

I’m passionate about data analytics, storytelling with data, and keeping up with the latest in AI and machine learning.

I work with tools like Python, SQL, TypeScript, R, and Excel to build projects and solve problems.
